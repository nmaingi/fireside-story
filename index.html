      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p> and all the LaunchCode students were very confused,
        walking up and down the large hall, staring at the ceiling.
        And just as an impossibly loud crack of lighting stuck, Ben
        stood up and said 'Class dismissed'. It was amazing because we
        could leave and even more amazing that we could hear him as he was in class
        and the students were in the hall!
