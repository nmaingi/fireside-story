      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p> and all the LaunchCode students were very confused,
        walking up and down the large hall, staring at the ceiling.
        And just as an impossibly loud crack of lighting stuck, Ben
        stood up and said 'Class dismissed', it was amazing because we
        could leave early and that we heard him as he was in class and the 
        students were in the hall.
